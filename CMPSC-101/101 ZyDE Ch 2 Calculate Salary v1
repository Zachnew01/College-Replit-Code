/*
2.11 C++ example: Salary calculation with variables

zyDE 2.11.1: Calculate salary: Generalize a program with variables and input.
The following program uses a variable workHoursPerWeek rather than directly using 40 in the salary calculation expression.

Run the program, observe the output. Change 40 to 35 (France's work week), and run again.
Generalize the program further by using a variable workWeeksPerYear. Run the program. Change 50 to 52, and run again.
Introduce a variable monthlySalary, used similarly to annualSalary, to further improve program readability.
